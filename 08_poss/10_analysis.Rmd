# Bones of the Game:
## Possession-based Performance Analysis for Rugby 7s

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library("gridExtra")

```

Analyzing rugby 7s performance is a difficult task. Game play can be fast paced and unstructured. The difference between winning or losing often seems to hinge on one bounce of the ball or a single moment of eye-popping individual brilliance. The performance analyst and coach are left with the difficult task of finding order in the apparent choas -- uncovering the key performance indicators underlying the spectacle.

Performance statistics borrowed from 15s do not transfer well to sevens. The most successful 7s teams often complete less passes, retain fewer rucks, and possess the ball for less time than their opponents. An analysis conducted by Starting 7s showed that An earlier study reported that pass completions and rucks indicate the _inability_ to score in rugby sevens. [[3]](http://www.rugby7.com/cm_genat.asp?L=E) 

Recent series results support this idea. In the 2014-2015 World Rugby Sevens Series, Japan and Brazil were near the top in passes per match and at or above the series average in time of possession. Yet both teams scored few points and rarely won. Scotland lead all core teams in pass completions, rucks won, and time of possession differential yet finished seventh overall -- strictly in the middle of the pack. Fiji and South Africa had less time of possession and passed less than the series average en route to finishing first and second overall. 

So the question remains unaswered. What statistic captures the importance of possession for rugby 7s?

This article explores the relationship between possession and winning using data from the 2014-2015 World Rugby Sevens Series. It examines __total possession count__ and __possession differential__ as statistics that connect possession to winning in rugby sevens. It includes R code and source data to reproduce the analysis.

## Possession defined

For the purposes of this study each possession should be thought of as a **continuous scoring opportunity**. It begins when a team holds the ball and ends when that team scores, turns the ball over to their opponent, or time expires. Stoppages due to penalties or infractions do not trigger new possessions unless the ball changes hands. It includes time that the ball is both in and out of play.

For example, a team wins a restart and plays several phases. During the course of play their opponent is penalized for not releasing. The team kicks the penalty to touch, wins the subsequent lineout, and scores a try. All of this activity is a single possession.

The idea of counting possession this way is borrowed from American football, where possession count and turnover ratio are key performance indicators. This approach differs from how possessions are counted on the World Sevens Series. A new possession is counted every time the ball is put into play regardless of whether the ball changes hands. This would be analagous to counting every snap as a new possession in American football.

Counting each continuous series of play as a single possession uncovers the relationship between possession and winning.

## Possessions per match

This section describes the average match in terms of ball possession. How many possessions are typical in a sevens match and how much does possession vary around this number?

1. Load supporting libraries and functions used to explore and graph the data into the R environment.

2. Download the _ws72014_possession_stats.csv_ data set from github. These data were collected through notational analysis of every rugby match in the 2014-2015 World Sevens Series.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("ws72014_poss.csv")) {
  download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jliberma/rugby7s/master/data/ws72014_possession_stats.csv", 
                destfile="ws72014_poss.csv", method="curl")
}

ws7s_poss <- read.csv("ws72014_poss.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

3. Each row of the data set represents a unique possession. Display the first five rows of the data set.

```{r}
head(ws7s_poss,5)
```

There are fourteen columns. The columns that pertain to this 
analysis include:

* SERIES.MATCH: series match number (1-405)
* HALF: 1 or 2
* POSS: cumulative per-match possession number including both teams
* TEAM: the team with possession
* OPP: their opponent

5. Count total possessions in each match with sapply() and save the result to _poss.per.match_.
```{r}
poss.per.match <- sapply(split(ws7s_poss,ws7s_poss$SERIES.MATCH), 
                         function(x) nrow(x))
```

6. _poss.per.match_ is the total possession count for each match including both teams. View the first ten entries in _poss.per.match_.

```{r}
head(poss.per.match,10)
```
Match 1 had `r poss.per.match[1]` total possessions, match 2 had `r poss.per.match[2]`, and so on.
 
7. Print summary statistics for _poss.per.match_ using the R summary() function.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(poss.per.match)
```

* The average possession count across all matches was `r round(mean(poss.per.match),2)` with a standard deviation of `r round(sd(poss.per.match),2)`. 
* The median average of `r median(poss.per.match)` agrees with the mean, indicating that the mean is probably representative of a typical match and not overly skewed by outliers. 
* `r min(poss.per.match)` and `r max(poss.per.match)` were the minimum and maximum total possession counts per match. 

8. Visualize how possession counts were distributed across matches by plotting _poss.per.match_ as a cumulative density function. 

The cumulative density function plots possessions per match on the X axis as a percentage of the total population on the Y axis. It shows that:

* Approximately 50% of all matches had between `r quantile(poss.per.match)[2]` and `r quantile(poss.per.match)[4]` total possessions. 
 between 15 and 19 possessions. 
* Less than 5% of all matches had fewer than 10 possessions or more than 30 possessions.

9. Plot the same data in a histogram. The histogram helps visualize the data distribution and its central tendency around the mean.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# ppm without finals
ws7s_poss_nofinals <- ws7s_poss %>%
  filter(!MATCH==45)
poss.per.match.nofinals <- sapply(split(ws7s_poss_nofinals,ws7s_poss_nofinals$SERIES.MATCH), 
                                  function(x) nrow(x))
# histogram of possessions per match
ppm <- qplot(poss.per.match, binwidth=1) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept=median(poss.per.match)+.5, colour="red") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Trebuchet MS", color="#666666")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=24, hjust=0)) +
  xlab("Possessions") + ylab("Count")

# cumulative distribution function of possessions per match
cdf <- data.frame(x=c(poss.per.match,poss.per.match.nofinals),
                  ggg=factor(rep(1:2, c(length(poss.per.match),
                                        length(poss.per.match.nofinals)))))
cdf_plot <- ggplot(cdf, aes(x, colour=ggg)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.3)) +
  xlab("Possessions") + ylab("Probability") + 
  stat_ecdf(geom="step") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Trebuchet MS", color="#666666")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=24, hjust=0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(position = "right") +
  scale_colour_hue(name="Legend", labels=c('FINALS','NOFINALS'))

# plot histogram and cdf side by side
title1=textGrob("Possessions per match", gp=gpar(fontface="bold", 
                                                 fontfamily="Trebuchet MS",
                                                 fontsize=24, col="#666666"))
caption1=textGrob("Source: http://starting7s.com", gp=gpar(fontsize=10,
                                                           fontfamily="Trebuchet MS",
                                                           col="#666666"))

grid.arrange(ppm, cdf_plot, ncol=2, 
             top = title1,
             bottom = caption1
             )
```
The X axis is the possession count per match. The Y axis is the number of matches at each possession count. The red line at ```r mean(poss.per.match)``` marks the series mean.

* At first glance the histogram appears to have a bell shaped distribution symmetrical around the mean.
* However, the histogram is slightly right-skewed. Matches that strayed from the mean tended to have more possessions rather than less. 

The graph does not show what causes the skew. It could be caused by 20 minute finals or overtime matches. Possession also changes more frequently in wet conditions due to tactical kicking and handling errors. The small outliers should not affect the overall analysis greatly .

10. According to the exploratory data analysis, _the majority of World Sevens Series matches had between 14 and 20 possessions_ , with an average of _17 total possessions between both teams_. 

Assuming both teams get equal possession -- an assumption we explore in the next section -- then each team has only four scoring opportunities per half.  When seen in this light, the critical importance of every rugby sevens possession becomes clear.

## Winning Possession Margin
The exploratory data analysis determined most of the 2014-2015 series matches had between 14 and 20 possessions. This section investigates how those possessions were divided between the winning and losing teams. This is called the **possession differential**. Does a favorable possession differential increase the likelihood of winning, and, if so, by how much? 

This section introduces a statistic called the **winning possession margin** (wpm) to help answer these questions. Wpm shows how many possessions the match winner had relative to the loser. Wpm is similar to the possession differnential except that it explcitly measures the differential from the standpoint of the eventual match winner. 

Calculate the wpm by subtracting the loser's possession count from the winner's. The result is positive when the winner had more possessions than the loser and negative when the winner had less possession than the loser. A wpm of zero means both teams had the same number of possessions in the match.

1. Start by scoring all matches using the match_score_poss() function provided by poss_func.R.

```{r}
all_scores <- match_score_poss(ws7s_poss)
```

2. Determine match winners and calculate the winning possession margin for each match by subtracting the loser's possession count from the winner's.
```{r}
wpm <- all_scores %>% 
  filter(! points.1 == points.2) %>%
  mutate(wpm = ifelse(points.1 > points.2, 
                      count.1-count.2, 
                      count.2-count.1), 
         pos = wpm >=0) %>%
  select(match, wpm, pos) %>%
  arrange(wpm)
```

Tie matches were removed from the analysis. There were `r 405-nrow(wpm)` ties which left `r nrow(wpm)` matches for analysis from the original data set.

3. Find the average, maximum, and minimum of all matches wpm using summary().

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(wpm[,2])
```

* Match winner's had an average wpm of `r round(mean(wpm[,2]),2)`. 
* The highest wpm was `r max(wpm[,2])`.
* The lowest wpm was `r min(wpm[,2])`.

4. Across all `r nrow(wpm)` match winners:
* **`r round(sum(wpm$wpm<0)/nrow(wpm),3)`%** had a negative wpm.
* **`r round(sum(wpm$wpm==0)/nrow(wpm),3)`%** had a wpm of zero. 
* **`r round(sum(wpm$wpm>0)/nrow(wpm),3)`%** had a positive wpm.

5. According to the summary statistics, match winner's with less possession than their opponents were rare. Visualize the wpm data to explore it further. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# plot winning possession margin
wpm1 <- ggplot(wpm, aes(x=match, y=wpm, fill=pos)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="identity") +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, colour="grey") +
  labs(title="Winning Possession Margin", subtitle="World Rugby Sevens Series 2014-2015", 
       y="Possession Margin", x="", caption="Source: http://starting7s.com") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Trebuchet MS", color="#666666")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=24, hjust=0)) +
  guides(fill=F) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
print(wpm1)
```

Each bar on the X axis of this graph corresponds to a series match. The height of each bar on the Y axis represents winning possession margin. Blue bars denote that that the winner had more possessions than the loser. Red bars deonte that the loser had more possessions than the winner. 

The chart dramatically conveys the advantage conferred by additional scoring opportunities:

* Most matches were won by the team with the possession advantage. The ratio of blue to red bars is about five to one.
* Positive wpms range from 1 to 7 while -3 was the smallest negative wpm. 
* No team with a possession disadvantage of four or more won a match.
* Only one team won with three fewer possessions than their opponent. 

## Does probability of winning increase as the possession margin increases?

Not surprisingly, teams with a possession advantage won more often than their opponent. However, it is interesting to note that a one possession advantage often separates winning from losing. This section investigates whether the probability of winning increases as the possession differential increases.

1. According to the previous section, possession differentials ranged from zero to seven. Calculate how many matches had absolute possession margins from one to seven. This calculation includes matches that ended in a tie.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tie_scores <- all_scores %>% 
  filter(points.1==points.2) %>%
  transmute(abs(count.1-count.2))

for (i in 0:7)
{
  # how to save this to a vector to be displayed later?
  j <- sum(abs(wpm$wpm)==i) + length(tie_scores[tie_scores==i]) 
  print(paste("wpm ==",i,":",j))
}
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# calculate win probability by possession margin
wpm2 <- wpm %>%
  group_by(wpm) %>%
  summarise(count=n())
win_prob <- round(wpm2[wpm2$wpm>=0,]$count /
                    sapply(split(wpm2,abs(wpm2$wpm)), 
                           function(x) sum(x$count)),2)
# create a data frame for ggplot
df <- data.frame(cbind(names=c("4-7","3","2","1"),
                       prob=win_prob[5:2]))
np<-ggplot(data=df, aes(x=names, y=prob)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=0.75, fill="steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Win Probability by Possession Advantage", subtitle="2014-2015 World Rugby Sevens Series", 
       y="Win Probability", x="Possession Advantage", caption="Source: http://starting7s.com") +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Trebuchet MS", color="#666666")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face="bold", size=24, hjust=0))

print(np)
```

2. Calculate the probability of winning at each positive possession margin.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
for (i in 1:7)
{
  j <- round(sum(wpm$wpm==i)/(sum(abs(wpm$wpm)==i) +
                          length(tie_scores[tie_scores==i])),2) 
  print(paste("wpm ==",i,":",j))
}
```

69% of all matches with a +1 possession differential were won by the team with more possession. The win percentge increased to 85% for teams with a +2 possession differential. A +3 possession differential resulted in a 97% probability of winning, and no team lost or tied with a possession differential of 4-7.


Discussion: Teams with extra possessions were more likely to win.

## Discussion

Existing metrics don't capture the importance of possession. Suggest defining a ball possession as a scoring opportunity that includes the time the ball is both in and out of play. The scoring opportunity does not end until the team scores, turns over the ball, or time expires.

The idea for counting possessions in this way is borrowed from American football, where turnover differential is a key performance indicator.

Contrast this to time of possession, or possession counts based on interruptions to game play. Possession statistics are tracked but not often mentioned on the World Sevens Series. In the World Sevens Series possession count is incremented after every stoppage in play regardless of whether the ball changes hands. With our approach the possession count does not increment after a set piece or penalty unless there is a change of possession. 

Using this method, a picture emerges that is consistent with the exeprience of playing 7s, and that also adequately weightst he importance of restarts. Each team gets roughly 4 chances to score per half. A team that manages to gain a possession advantage -- in terms of count, not time -- increases there chances of winning. The team that holds the ball especially while it is out of play deprives their opponents of a scoring opportunity. 

In 1/3 of cases the possession count was equal, and in almost half it was equal of less. Therefore, possession count is a good step forward but does not present a complete picture. Possession efficiency, which is the likelihood that a team will score when given the opportunity.

Logically we can assume possession count is roughly equal between both teams.

By combining these findings with those from the previous section, the importance of each ball possession begins to emerge. In a typical match each team will have 3-5 scoring opportunities per half. If the opponent gains even one additional possession in a half their odds of winning increase drastically. A three possession disadvantage is almost insurmountable in rugby sevens.

Matches average 17 total possessions, so in the average match the winner has 9 possessions versus 8 for the loser.

Not surprisingly, winners had more scoring opportunities on average than the losers.

The Winning Possession Margin is a useful statistic for considering the relationship between ball possession and victory.
